Question: On the Golub et al. (1999) data set, find the expression values for the GRO2 GRO2 
oncogene and the GRO3 GRO3 oncogene. (Hint: Use grep() to find the gene rows 
in golub.gnames. Review module 2, or page 12 of the textbook on how to do this. 
Be careful to search only in the column with gene names.) 
 
(a) Find the correlation between the expression values of these two genes. 
 
(b) Find the parametric 90% confident interval for the correlation with cor.test(). 
(Hint: use ?cor.test to learn how to set the confidence level different from 
the default value of 95%.) 
 
(c) Find the bootstrap 90% confident interval for the correlation.

```{r}
library(multtest)
data(golub)
gol.fac <- factor(golub.cl, levels=0:1, labels = c("ALL", "AML"))
```


```{r}
grep("GRO2",golub.gnames[,2])
grep("GRO3",golub.gnames[,2])
```

part a 

```{r}
x<-golub[2714,] #GRO2
y<-golub[2715,] #GRO3
plot(x,y,xlab=golub.gnames[2714,3],ylab=golub.gnames[2715,3]) #plot gene expressions
```
```{r}
cor(x,y) #calculate correlation between two genes 
```

part b - 90% parametric confidence interval 

```{r}
cor.test(x, y, conf.level = 0.90)
```

part c - 90% bootstrap confident interval 

```{r}
nboot <- 2000
boot.cor <- matrix(0,nrow=nboot,ncol=1) #Vector to save re sampled statistic 
data <- cbind(x,y)
for (i in 1:nboot){
  data.star <- data[sample(1:nrow(data),replace=TRUE),]
  boot.cor[i,] <- cor(data.star[,1], data.star[,2])
}
quantile(boot.cor[,1],c(0.05,0.95))
```

QUESTION: On the Golub et al. (1999) data set, we consider the correlation between the Zyxin 
gene expression values and each of the gene in the data set. 
 
(a) How many of the genes have correlation values less than negative 0.5? 
(Those genes are highly negatively correlated with Zyxin gene). 
 
(b) Find the gene names for the top five genes that are most negatively 
correlated with Zyxin gene. 
 
(c)   Using the t-test, how many genes are negatively correlated with the Zyxin 
gene? Use a false discovery rate of 0.05. (Hint: use cor.test() to get the 
p-values then adjust for FDR. Notice that we want a one-sided test here.)

```{r}
grep("Zyxin",golub.gnames[,2])
```

part a 

```{r}
golub <- data.frame(golub)
zyxin_expression_cor <- apply(golub,1,cor, as.numeric(golub[2124,]))
cor.lessthan0.5 <- zyxin_expression_cor < 0.5
sum(cor.lessthan0.5)
```

part b

```{r}
order_genes <-order(zyxin_expression_cor)
golub.gnames[order_genes,][1:5,2]
```

part c

```{r}
golub <- data.frame(golub)
zyx_neg_cor <- apply(golub,1,function(x) cor.test(x, as.numeric(golub[2124,]), alternative = "less")$p.value)
p.fdrzyx <- p.adjust(p=zyx_neg_cor, method = "fdr")
sum(p.fdrzyx<0.05)
```


QUESTION: On the Golub et al. (1999) data set, regress the expression values for the GRO3 
GRO3 oncogene on the expression values of the GRO2 GRO2 oncogene.   
 
(a) Is there a statistically significant linear relationship between the two genes’ 
expression? Use appropriate statistical analysis to make the conclusion. 
What proportion of the GRO3 GRO3 oncogene expression’s variation can 
be explained by the regression on GRO2 GRO2 oncogene expression? 
 
(b) Test if the slope parameter is less than 0.5 at the α = 0.05 level.   
 
(c) Find an 80% prediction interval for the GRO3 GRO3 oncogene expression 
when GRO2 GRO2 oncogene is not expressed (zero expression value). 
 
(d) Check the regression model assumptions. Can we trust the statistical 
inferences from the regression fit?

```{r}
GRO3 <- as.numeric(golub[2715,]) 
GRO2 <- as.numeric(golub[2714,])
lin.regGolub <- lm(GRO3 ~ GRO2)
lin.regGolub
```

part a

```{r}
cor.test(GRO3, GRO2)
```

We can see from the pearson's product-moment correlation test, there is a moderately strong positive linear relationship between the expression values of the genes. This is evident from the rather large R value of around 0.8 and the very small p-value of 2.2*10^-9

```{r}
summary(lin.regGolub)
```

63.46% of the GRO3 expression variation can be explained by regression on GRO2 expression. 

part b

```{r}
confint(lin.regGolub, level = 0.9)
```

The slope parameter is less than 0.5 at the alpha 5% (0.05) level 

part c 

```{r}
predict(lin.regGolub, newdata=data.frame(GRO2=0), interval = "prediction", level = 0.80)
```

part d 

```{r}
shapiro.test(resid(lin.regGolub))
```

p-value is greater than 0.05 thus we fail to reject the null hypothesis of normality. The assumption for normality holds and we can trust the inferences from the regression fit 

QUESTION: For this problem, work with the data set stackloss that comes with R. You can get 
help on the data set with ?stackloss command. That shows you the basic 
information and source reference of the data set. Note: it is a data frame with four 
variables. The variable stack.loss contains the ammonia loss in a manufacturing 
(oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid) plant measured on 21 consecutive days. We 
try to predict it using the other three variables: air flow (Air.Flow) to the plant, 
cooling water inlet temperature (C) (Water.Temp), and acid concentration 
(Acid.Conc.)   
 
(a) Regress stack.loss on the other three variables. What is the fitted regression 
equation? 
 
(b) Do all three variables have statistical significant effect on stack.loss? What 
proportion of variation in stack.loss is explained by the regression on the 
other three variables? 
 
(c) Find a 90% confidence interval and 90% prediction interval for stack.loss 
when Air.Flow=60, Water.Temp=20 and Acid.Conc.=90. 

```{r}
data("stackloss")
```

part a 

```{r}
lin.reg <- lm(stack.loss~Air.Flow+Water.Temp+Acid.Conc.,data = stackloss)
summary(lin.reg)
```

fitted regression equation: Stack.Loss = -39.92 +0.72Air.FLow + 1.30Water.Temp -0.15Acid.Conc.

part b 

No, not all three variables have a statistically significant effect on stack loss. Air flow and water temperature do but acid concentration does not. Together the variables explain 91.36% of total variation in stack loss. 

part c - 90% confidence and prediction intervals

```{r}
predict(lin.reg, data.frame(Air.Flow=60,Water.Temp=20,Acid.Conc.=90),interval = "confidence", level = 0.90)
```

```{r}
predict(lin.reg, data.frame(Air.Flow=60,Water.Temp=20,Acid.Conc.=90),interval = "prediction", level = 0.90)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
